# 📍 Shortest Path Finder (Dijkstra’s Algorithm)

This Java project implements Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest path in a weighted, directed graph using a custom min-heap priority queue.

---

## ✅ Features

- Builds a graph with custom Vertex and Edge classes
- Uses Dijkstra’s algorithm to find shortest paths
- Returns both path and total distance
- Uses a custom min-heap with updateable priorities

---

## 📁 Files

- `ShortestPaths.java` – main algorithm
- `DirectedGraph.java` – graph structure
- `Vertex.java` / `Edge.java` – nodes and edges
- `MinHeap.java` – priority queue
- `PQEntry.java` – heap entries
- `VertexAndDist.java` – distance tracking
- `Main.java` – sample usage

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Compile all `.java` files
2. Run `Main.java` to test shortest path calculation
